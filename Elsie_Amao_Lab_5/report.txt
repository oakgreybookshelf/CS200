Part I

1. It's better to implement a deque as a doubly linked list
because a deck can add/remove from the front and the back.
A single linked list can only  be edited at the front.

2. It would not be necessary to implement a deque as a 
circularly linked list because a deque doesn't need to shift
indeces.

3. Yes it would beenfit from a tail reference, because when
the last element is removed a pointer is needed to identify
the new last element. It would be in addition to a head references
because the deque can add/remove from the beginning and end.

4.
